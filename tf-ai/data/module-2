1. Universal
CryptoBadges that you issued can be used universally across different platforms. You can use scuba diver badges issued by a diver training organization to get discounts on diving gear. Holders of an alumni badge can be invited to useful offline conferences. Badges earned in an online community can be displayed on the user profile in a recruiting site, or used as free passes for another community.

2. Eternal
CryptoBadge is imperishable and can be stored permanently on a blockchain. Praise and recognition are not physically preserved in the offline world, and even the value of digitalized certificates or endorsements can disappear at any time with the certificate issuers' status. With CryptoBadge, you can allow your winners to store their achievements, experience, and contributions in a quantifiable manner for permanent use.

3. Verifiable
CryptoBadge provides verifiable acknowledgments. Information such as issuer, issuing conditions, and other related data is stored on the blockchain in a manipulation-proof way. It also provides APIs that allow third parties to verify the authenticity of badges. Through CryptoBadge, badge winners can provide verified information about their unique, multifaceted identity that everybody can trust."
"CryptoBadge enables people to tokenize and assetize their merits such as achievements, experiences, and contributions, which proves their expertise, credibility, reputations, and more.
CryptoBadge winners can safely store the bits of their experiences on the blockchain. CryptoBadge winners collect tokens of all kinds, from achieving Champion Level at Clash Royale, completing a triathlon in Kona, Hawaii, tasting a limited edition wine in a private winery, visiting 500 travel destinations, donating to UNICEF, to supporting a famous idol group, BTS."
"CryptoBadge increases community engagement by providing social infrastructures and gamification.

1. Internal reputation system
CryptoBadge provides an internal reputation system. Recognizing people's contributions and merits is crucial for building a strong community.

2. Cross-community reputation applicability/transferability
As the self-sovereign owner of their identity data, users can choose to bring badges earned in other communities to your platform if you allow them.

3. Authorization
As a community operator, you can assign roles based on users' badge holding status. Such system can be useful when it comes to designing a sophisticated decision-making structure for your community.

4. User rewards
While winning a badge is a rewarding experience, you can provide badge winners with additional rewards such as points and tokens through Candy Machine.

5. Gamification
Along with CAN's gamification modules like d.quest, Candy Machine, Moim, and more, CryptoBadge offers the easiest method for gamifying your community or service, complete with intuitive and user-friendly admin features."
